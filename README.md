# Code Repository for DAN and BPE Models

This repository contains the implementation of the Deep Averaging Network (DAN) for parts 1a and 1b, and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for question 2.

## File Structure

- **DANmodels.py**  
  This file contains the implementation of the Deep Averaging Network (DAN) used in part 1a and part 1b.

- **BPE.py**  
  This file contains the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm used for question 2.

- **main.py**  
  The main script that runs both the DAN models and BPE encoding based on the input arguments.

## Usage

You can run different parts of the project using the following commands.

### Part 1a and 1b: Deep Averaging Network (DAN)

To run the DAN model for part 1a and 1b, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py model DAN
```

### Question 2: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

To run the BPE encoding for question 2, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py model BPE
```
